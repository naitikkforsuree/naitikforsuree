            My Dearest Akshita,<br>I don’t even know where to begin because my heart feels so heavy right now. I know you’re upset, nd I wish I could fully understand what’s caused this. All I can say is tht I’m truly sorry if I’ve hurt you in anyway. The thought of losing you or seeing our BEAUTIFUL BOND end like this tears me apart, nd I can’t imagine my days without you and connection we share... I want you to know how much you mean to me. Our BOND isn’t just a part of my life—it is my life. Every snap of yours, every convos, nd every moment we’ve shared is precious to me. I never want to lose that. I never want to lose us.<br> 🫂❤

          <p>Maybe I’ve made mistakes, maybe I haven’t been as perfect as I should have been, but my love for you has always been pure, genuine, nd unshakable. I would do anything to make things right because you are worth fighting for Princess...<br>I understand if you need space right now, nd I respect tht... But I also want you to know that I’m here for you, always. In moments like this, I realize more than ever how much I want to support you through everything—your highs, your lows, your successes, nd your struggles. I’ll always be your biggest supporter, someone you can count on no matter what<br>We’ve been through so much together, nd every challenge has only made us stronger. I believe this too is a challenge we can overcome.
